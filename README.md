# vim-bats

This plugin adds a `:Bats` command that runs bats. It also sets up files with
a .bats extension to be highlighted as shell scripts, since that's ultimately
what they are.

## Installation

With [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) just do:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/markcornick/vim-bats.git

If you prefer to use something besides pathogen, go ahead.
